2. **Rush hour penalty**: +4.2 minutes average delay during peak hours
3. **Weather impact**: Storm conditions cause +15 minutes vs clear weather
4. **Track congestion**: High utilization routes have +8.3 minutes delay
5. **Signal failures**: Most common cause (25% of all delays)

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Custom Analysis
```python
from railway_analysis_examples import RailwayDatasetAnalyzer

analyzer = RailwayDatasetAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.run_complete_analysis()

# Access specific components
model = results['model_performance'][0]  # Trained model
insights = results['insights']           # Operational insights
ml_data = results['ml_dataset']         # Preprocessed data
```

### Graph Neural Network Setup
```python
# Railway network as graph structure
import networkx as nx

# Nodes: junctions, Edges: tracks with features
G = nx.Graph()

# Add junctions as nodes
for _, junction in junctions.iterrows():
    G.add_node(junction['Junction_ID'], 
               type='junction',
               capacity=junction['Max_Capacity'])

# Add tracks as edges  
for _, track in tracks.iterrows():
    G.add_edge(track['Start_Junction'], track['End_Junction'],
               length=track['Track_Length'],
               capacity=track['Max_Capacity'],
               track_type=track['Track_Type'])
```

### Time Series Analysis
```python
# Seasonal decomposition of delays
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

# Group by month for trend analysis
monthly_delays = performance.groupby(
    performance['Date'].dt.to_period('M')
)['Delay_Minutes'].mean()

decomposition = seasonal_decompose(monthly_delays, model='additive')
trend = decomposition.trend
seasonal = decomposition.seasonal
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: ModuleNotFoundError during generation
```bash
# Solution: Install dependencies
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

**Issue**: Out of memory during analysis
```python
# Solution: Process in chunks
chunk_size = 10000
for chunk in pd.read_csv('historical_performance_data.csv', chunksize=chunk_size):
    # Process chunk
    pass
```

**Issue**: Slow performance on large dataset
```python
# Solution: Use optimized data types
df = pd.read_csv('file.csv', dtype={
    'Train_ID': 'category',
    'Weather_Conditions': 'category',
    'Delay_Minutes': 'float32'
})
```

### Performance Optimization
- Use **categorical dtypes** for string columns
- **Index** frequently queried columns
- **Chunk processing** for memory-constrained environments
- **Parallel processing** with multiprocessing/dask for large-scale analysis
